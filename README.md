# EddieDover.dev

This is a repository for my personal website.

It is split into two parts:
 - A Backend Restful API using:
   - Python
   - Flask
   - Python-dotenv
 - A Frontend using:
   - TypeScript
   - React
   - Material-UI

To build the frontend for production simply run **yarn build** in the primary folder.

The backend api is a wsgi ready python application.
